# JSC Unlocker üçÄüîí

Removes the virtual keyboard login/register on [jogossantacasa.pt](https://www.jogossantacasa.pt/), making the password fields editable and allowing password managers to autofill them. The virtual keyboard also becomes invisible.

**BONUS: Copy & Paste also works when using this extension!**
